Weather App ☁️🌦️
A dynamic weather app that displays real-time weather information based on the user's location or a searched city. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, and cloudiness. It includes two modes: Your Weather (using geolocation) and Search Weather (by city name). The interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a clean, responsive design with animated loading states for a smooth user experience.
